# AI Image Gallery

## Description

AI Image Gallery is a web app that lets you create and view amazing images generated by artificial intelligence. You are able to use a suggested prompt provided by the chatgpt API or create your very own unique prompt. Once you have the desired prompt, the DALL-E API is used to generate a corresponding image.

Once the image has been generated, it is saved via Azure Blob Storage and displayed in the gallery. You can also view the images generated by other users, and hovering over an image will display the specific prompt used to generate it. I had a lot of fun creating this project and I hope you enjoy messing around with it!

### Technologies Used: 
- React
- Node.js
- Typescript
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure Functions
- Next.js 
- Tailwind CSS
- DALL-E and chatgpt APIs (OPENAI)
